To validate the time-resolving capabilities of the GEANT4/GAMOS tissue optics package, a simulation similar to Fang et al. was performed.  A 60 x 60 x 60 mm3 homogenous domain with an origin located at the center of the domain was generated with a point source located at (0,0,60) mm incident with an initial direction of (0,0,-1) and the following optical properties: nrel = 1.0, absorption coefficient μa = 0.005 mm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 1 mm-1, and anisotropy factor g = 0.01.  The entire cubic domain was split into 2 x 2 x 2 mm3 voxels, and the temporal fluence was recorded for the voxel with a centroid located at (0,-16,20) mm by scoring the average track length of photons traversing the voxel by the absorption coefficient of the voxel.
