For a mismatched boundary condition, we perform a similar simulation for a semi-infinite slab with the following optical properties: nrel = 1.5 (mismatched boundary condition), absorption coefficient μa = 10 cm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 90 cm-1, anisotropy factor g = 0 (isotropic scattering), and slab thickness d = 0.02 cm.  To approximate a semi-infinite medium the slab cross section was set to 10 x 10 cm2.
