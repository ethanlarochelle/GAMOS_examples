We reproduce the validation used to verify the MCML package and use the GEANT4/GAMOS tissue optics package to compute the angularly resoled diffuse reflectance and transmittance of a semi-infinite slab with the following optical properties: nrel = 1.0, absorption coefficient μa = 10 cm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 90 cm-1, anisotropy factor g = 0.75, and slab thickness d = 0.02 cm.  To approximate a semi-infinite medium the slab cross section was set to 10 x 10 cm2.
