To validate the accuracy of the GEANT4/GAMOS tissue optics package in resolving 2D fluence in a homogenous miedum, a simulation was performed with an identical geometry to that used for the temporal resolved fluence with optical properties of: nrel = 1.0, absorption coefficient μa = 0.005 mm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 1 mm-1, and anisotropy factor g = 0.01. However, in this case the fluence was recorded in a 30 x 30 grid of 2 x 2 x 2 mm3 voxels centered at y = 0 mm in the 60 x 60 x 60 mm3 homogenous medium domain.
