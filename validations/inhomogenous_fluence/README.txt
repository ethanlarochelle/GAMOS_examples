To validate the accuracy of the GEANT4/GAMOS tissue optics package in resolving 2D fluence in an inhomogenous medium, a simulation was performed with a similar geometry to that used for the homogenous 2D fluence validation: nrel = 1.0, absorption coefficient μa = 0.002 mm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 1 mm-1, and anisotropy factor g = 0.01. However, a spherical inclusion with a radius of 10 mm was centered inside the cubic medium with optical properties: nrel = 1.0, absorption coefficient μa = 0.05 mm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 5 mm-1, and anisotropy factor g = 0.9.  The fluence was recorded in a 30 x 30 grid of 2 x 2 x 2 mm3 voxels centered at y = 0 mm in the 60 x 60 x 60 mm3 homogenous medium domain.
