To validate the optical physics of the tissue optics package, we start by conducting a simulation analogous to the validation of MCML by Wang et al. in which the total diffuse reflectance, Rd, and total transmittance Td (including unscattered transmittance) are calculated for a semi-infinite slab with the following optical properties: relative refractive index nrel = 1.0 (matched boundary condition), absorption coefficient μa = 10 cm-1, scattering coefficient μs = 90 cm-1, anisotropy factor g = 0.75, and slab thickness d = 0.02 cm.  To approximate a semi-infinite medium the slab cross section was set to 10 x 10 cm2.
